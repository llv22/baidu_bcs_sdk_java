/**
 * Daemon thread to periodically check connection pools for idle connections.
 *
 * <p>
 * Connections sitting around idle in the HTTP connection pool for too long will eventually be terminated by the BCE end
 * of the connection, and will go into CLOSE_WAIT. If this happens, sockets will sit around in CLOSE_WAIT, still using
 * resources on the client side to manage that socket. Many sockets stuck in CLOSE_WAIT can prevent the OS from creating
 * new connections.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class closes idle connections before they can move into the CLOSE_WAIT state.
 *
 * <p>
 * This thread is important because by default, we disable Apache HttpClient's stale connection checking, so without
 * this thread running in the background, cleaning up old/inactive HTTP connections, we'd see more IO exceptions when
 * stale connections (i.e. closed on the BCE side) are left in the connection pool, and requests grab one of them to
 * begin executing a request.
