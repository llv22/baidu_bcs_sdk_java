 * Extension of BceClientException that represents an error response returned by a BCE service.
 * Receiving an exception of this type indicates that the caller's request was correctly transmitted to the service,
 * but for some reason, the service was not able to process it, and returned an error response instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * BceServiceException provides callers several pieces of information that can be used to obtain more information
 * about the error and why it occurred. In particular, the errorType field can be used to determine if the caller's
 * request was invalid, or the service encountered an error on the server side while processing it.
